# CASK: Cellular Analysis of Spatiotemporal K-functions

**CASK** (*Cellular Analysis of Spatiotemporal K-functions*) is a repository accompanying the publication **"Spatial and temporal signatures of cell competition revealed by K-function analysis"**. This repository provides Jupyter notebooks for spatiotemporal K-function clustering analysis, a quantitative method to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular competition.

## Key Features
- **K-function Analysis**: Quantitatively evaluates the spatial and temporal clustering of wild-type cell mitoses relative to mutant cell elimination events.
- **Publication-focused**: Reproduces key findings from the study.
- **Simple Setup**: No installation; just explore the included Jupyter notebooks.

## Whatâ€™s Included
- Jupyter notebooks for K-function clustering analysis.
- Sample data for testing the K-function analysis.
- Example outputs for reproducing key results.

*Note:* This repository **does not** include segmentation or tracking tools. Those were performed using other tools and repositories described in the publication.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cask.git
   cd cask
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Navigate to the provided notebooks and explore the analysis.
